<h3 data-start="1551" data-end="1587">How Do Packaging Adhesives Work?</h3>
<p data-start="1589" data-end="1751">Packaging adhesives work by creating a strong bond between different materials used in packaging. Depending on the type of adhesive, the bonding process can vary:</p>
<ul data-start="1753" data-end="2528">
<li data-start="1753" data-end="1981">
<p data-start="1755" data-end="1981"><strong data-start="1755" data-end="1780">Water-based adhesives</strong>: These adhesives use water as a solvent and are typically used for paper-based packaging like cartons and labels. They are environmentally friendly and offer strong adhesion once the water evaporates.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1985" data-end="2175">
<p data-start="1987" data-end="2175"><strong data-start="1987" data-end="2014">Solvent-based adhesives</strong>: These adhesives are used for demanding applications where stronger bonding is required. They are often used for bonding plastics or other non-porous materials.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="2179" data-end="2373">
<p data-start="2181" data-end="2373"><strong data-start="2181" data-end="2203">Hot melt adhesives</strong>: Applied in molten form, these adhesives bond as they cool down, making them fast-drying and ideal for high-speed packaging applications like case sealing and cartoning.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="2377" data-end="2528">
<p data-start="2379" data-end="2528"><strong data-start="2379" data-end="2411">Pressure-sensitive adhesives</strong>: These adhesives bond when pressure is applied, and are commonly used for self-adhesive labels, tapes, and stickers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="2530" data-end="2704">The choice of adhesive depends on the packaging materials being used and the specific needs of the application, such as flexibility, heat resistance, or speed of application.</p>
