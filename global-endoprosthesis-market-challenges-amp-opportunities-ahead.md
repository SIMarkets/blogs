<h3>What is an Endoprosthesis?</h3>
<p>An endoprosthesis is an artificial device implanted in the body to replace or support a damaged or diseased joint or bone. Commonly used in orthopedic and oncological surgeries, endoprostheses are most frequently associated with hip and knee replacements. However, they are also used in other applications, such as shoulder, elbow, and ankle replacements, as well as in reconstructive surgeries following trauma or cancer.</p>
<p>Endoprostheses are typically made from biocompatible materials such as titanium, cobalt-chromium alloys, and polyethylene, which ensure durability and minimize the risk of rejection or adverse reactions.</p>
