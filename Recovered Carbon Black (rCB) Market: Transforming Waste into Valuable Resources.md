<h3 data-start="792" data-end="848"><strong data-start="796" data-end="848">What Is the Recovered Carbon Black (rCB) Market?</strong></h3>
<p data-start="850" data-end="1230"><strong data-start="850" data-end="882">Recovered Carbon Black (rCB)</strong>&nbsp;refers to carbon black that has been reclaimed from end-of-life products, particularly used tires. The process involves extracting carbon black from waste tires using pyrolysis or other recycling technologies. Once recovered, the carbon black can be reprocessed and used in a wide range of applications where virgin carbon black is typically used.</p>
<p data-start="1232" data-end="1594">Carbon black itself is a fine, black powder made from burning hydrocarbons in insufficient air. It is used primarily as a reinforcing agent in rubber products (such as tires) and as a black pigment in inks and coatings. Traditional carbon black production is energy-intensive and relies on fossil fuels, making it a target for eco-conscious innovations like rCB.</p>
<h3 data-start="1601" data-end="1663"><strong data-start="1605" data-end="1663">How Does the Recovered Carbon Black (rCB) Market Work?</strong></h3>
<p data-start="1665" data-end="1781">The rCB market operates through the recycling of used tires and other rubber products. Here's how the process works:</p>
<ol data-start="1783" data-end="2610">
<li data-start="1783" data-end="2084">
<p data-start="1786" data-end="2084"><strong data-start="1786" data-end="1824">Pyrolysis or Thermal Decomposition</strong>: Waste tires are heated in a controlled, low-oxygen environment to break down the rubber and separate the carbon black from other materials. This method produces rCB along with other byproducts like oil and gas, which can be further used in energy generation.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="2088" data-end="2378">
<p data-start="2091" data-end="2378"><strong data-start="2091" data-end="2122">Purification and Processing</strong>: After recovery, the carbon black is processed and purified to meet the necessary standards required for its reuse in various industries. The rCB must match or surpass the quality and performance characteristics of virgin carbon black for it to be viable.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="2380" data-end="2610">
<p data-start="2383" data-end="2610"><strong data-start="2383" data-end="2409">Reuse and Applications</strong>: The recovered carbon black is then reintroduced into the supply chain, particularly in industries where carbon black is a key material&mdash;rubber production, coatings, inks, plastics, and even batteries.</p>
</li>
