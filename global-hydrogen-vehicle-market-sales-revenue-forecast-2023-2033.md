<h3 data-start="539" data-end="576"><strong data-start="543" data-end="574">What Are Hydrogen Vehicles?</strong></h3>
<p data-start="577" data-end="1002">Hydrogen vehicles are a type of electric vehicle that uses hydrogen gas to power an electric motor. These vehicles utilize hydrogen fuel cells, which combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, emitting only water vapor as a byproduct. Unlike battery electric vehicles, hydrogen vehicles offer faster refueling times and longer driving ranges, making them ideal for long-distance travel and commercial applications.</p>
<h3 data-start="1009" data-end="1049"><strong data-start="1013" data-end="1047">How Do Hydrogen Vehicles Work?</strong></h3>
<p data-start="1050" data-end="1172">Hydrogen vehicles operate by converting hydrogen gas into electricity through a fuel cell. Here&rsquo;s how the process works:</p>
