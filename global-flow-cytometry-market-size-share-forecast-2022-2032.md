<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>What is Flow Cytometry?</strong></h2>
<p>Flow cytometry is a laser-based technology used to detect and measure physical and chemical characteristics of cells or particles. It enables researchers to examine thousands of cells per second, providing detailed information on size, complexity, and fluorescence properties. The technique is commonly used in immunology, cancer research, microbiology, and stem cell analysis.</p>
<h2><strong>How Does Flow Cytometry Work?</strong></h2>
<p>Flow cytometry involves the following key steps:</p>
<ol start="1" data-spread="false">
<li>
<p><strong>Sample Preparation:</strong>&nbsp;Cells are suspended in a fluid and treated with specific fluorescent markers that bind to target molecules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flow System:</strong>&nbsp;The sample is injected into a stream of fluid, creating a single-cell suspension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optical Detection:</strong>&nbsp;A laser beam illuminates the cells, and detectors capture scattered and emitted light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Analysis:</strong>&nbsp;The collected data is processed and displayed as histograms or scatter plots, allowing researchers to interpret cell properties.</p>
</li>
</ol>
